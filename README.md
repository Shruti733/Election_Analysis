# Election_Analysis (Python project)

## Overview of Project

In this project, we were working on a election result data-set using Python to automate tasks and conduct data analysis.
Python handles large data files and performs complex calculations quickly and helps to access, process, manipulate and store data.

### Purpose

precinct using python to get a summary of the election results. Various parameters were calculated to analyse the election
results:
